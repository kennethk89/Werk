# WERK

Still in progress!!

For the lack of a better name, Werk aims to connect friends and freelance co-workers with by having them do less written communication, and more visual link ups.

## Problems

You're a freelancer, a student, an independant worker, a group of remote workers; chances are you've been in situations where you've to reply to your work buddies on where you're working today, and what you're going to be doing tomorrow etc.. while trying to just churn work out. When it comes to meeting someone to co-work together, be it on same or separate projects, it is tiring to have to plan and organize where to meet and the same details that follow. Now imagine having to do that in a group of up to 5!
* lots of updating
* very few decisions with a lot of chattery
* loads of opinions flying around

Werk aims to simplify communication by allowing users to create events that pop up on a map, these events can be catered to be seen by your friends, your group or by general public. All the basic details of the event will be included in a pop up box on the map and other users can either choose to join or not.

The idea of working together is great, but the thought of having to organize that isn't so great.

## Tech Stack and APIs

Werk uses the following web technologies:
* MongoDB
* Express
* Node
* React
* Google Maps API from React-Google-Maps NPM Library
